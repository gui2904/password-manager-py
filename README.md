# Password Manager
This project was created in Python, its pretty straight forward. Once main.py gets executed for the first time, it will create a "secret.key" file which is the decryption key for your passwords and a "credentials.json" file, which will contain the name of
the website, along with the email, and the password, which will be encrypted.
for more information on how to use the app, type ```python3 main.py --help```
